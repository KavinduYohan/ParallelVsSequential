# ParallelVsSequential
This project explores the comparison between sequential and parallel approaches in neural network feature extraction, highlighting efficiency improvements in audio classification models.

About joblib
joblib is a Python library designed for lightweight pipelining, particularly for tasks that require performance optimization such as parallel computation and efficient serialization. It is widely used in machine learning workflows and data science projects.

Key Features:
Parallelism: Simplifies parallel execution of tasks using multiple cores with minimal code changes.
Efficient Serialization: Optimized for storing and loading large numpy arrays or other Python objects to disk.
Caching: Provides a robust caching mechanism to avoid redundant computation by reusing results of expensive function calls.
How it Works:
Parallel Processing: Use joblib.Parallel with joblib.delayed to parallelize loop-based or independent computations.
Serialization: Use joblib.dump to save Python objects (e.g., trained models) and joblib.load to retrieve them efficiently.
Caching: Use joblib.Memory to persist results of computationally expensive operations and reuse them automatically if inputs remain unchanged.
